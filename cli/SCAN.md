## Detailed Reports

### internal/api/client.go

**Overall Score:** 8.5/10

#### Maintainability (Score: 8.5/10)

- ðŸ”µ INFO [missing logging] The `AnalyzeCode` function doesn't log any errors or information. Consider adding logging to improve debuggability.
  - Line: 29
  - Suggestion: Add logging to improve debuggability

- ðŸ”µ INFO [missing tests] There are no tests for the `AnalyzeCode` function. Consider adding tests to improve code reliability.
  - Line: 1
  - Suggestion: Add tests to improve code reliability

#### Best Practices (Score: 9.0/10)

- ðŸ”µ INFO [missing validation] The `AnalyzeCode` function doesn't validate the input code. Consider adding validation to prevent errors.
  - Line: 29
  - Suggestion: Add validation to prevent errors

- ðŸ”µ INFO [missing error handling] The `AnalyzeCode` function doesn't handle all possible errors. Consider adding error handling to improve robustness.
  - Line: 29
  - Suggestion: Add error handling to improve robustness

#### Security (Score: 9.0/10)

- ðŸ”µ INFO [insecure protocol] The base URL uses an insecure protocol (http). Consider using https instead.
  - Line: 11
  - Suggestion: Update the base URL to use https

- ðŸ”µ INFO [missing error handling] The client's timeout is set to 30 seconds, but there is no error handling for timeouts.
  - Line: 24
  - Suggestion: Add error handling for timeouts

#### Performance (Score: 8.0/10)

- ðŸ”µ INFO [inefficient memory allocation] The `jsonBody` variable is allocated on the heap, but it's not necessary. Consider using a buffer instead.
  - Line: 37
  - Suggestion: Use a buffer to reduce memory allocation

- ðŸ”µ INFO [missing caching] The `AnalyzeCode` function makes a new HTTP request every time it's called. Consider adding caching to reduce the number of requests.
  - Line: 29
  - Suggestion: Add caching to reduce the number of requests

#### Code Quality (Score: 9.0/10)

- ðŸ”µ INFO [missing comments] Some functions and variables are missing comments. Consider adding comments to improve code readability.
  - Line: 1
  - Suggestion: Add comments to improve code readability

- ðŸ”µ INFO [magic numbers] The timeout value (30 seconds) is a magic number. Consider defining a constant for it.
  - Line: 24
  - Suggestion: Define a constant for the timeout value

#### General Suggestions

- Consider using a more robust HTTP client library
- Add support for multiple API endpoints
- Improve error handling and logging
- Add caching and validation to improve performance and reliability

### internal/config/config.go

**Overall Score:** 8.5/10

#### Security (Score: 9.0/10)

- ðŸ”µ INFO [key management] The encryption key is stored in a file with permissions 0600, which is good for security. However, it's still possible for an attacker to access the key if they have access to the user's home directory.
  - Suggestion: Consider using a more secure key management system, such as a Hardware Security Module (HSM) or a secure key store.

- ðŸ”µ INFO [error handling] The error handling in the getOrCreateKey function does not check if the key file is readable before trying to read it.
  - Line: 43
  - Suggestion: Add a check to ensure the key file is readable before trying to read it.

#### Performance (Score: 8.0/10)

- ðŸ”µ INFO [file I/O] The code reads and writes files multiple times, which can be slow. Consider caching the encryption key and API key in memory.
  - Suggestion: Implement caching for the encryption key and API key to reduce file I/O operations.

#### Code Quality (Score: 9.0/10)

- ðŸ”µ INFO [code organization] The code is well-organized, but some functions are quite long. Consider breaking them down into smaller functions for better readability.
  - Suggestion: Break down long functions into smaller, more manageable functions.

#### Maintainability (Score: 8.5/10)

- ðŸ”µ INFO [magic numbers] The code uses magic numbers (e.g., 0600, 32) without explanation. Consider defining constants for these values.
  - Suggestion: Define constants for magic numbers to improve code readability.

#### Best Practices (Score: 9.0/10)

- ðŸ”µ INFO [commenting] The code could benefit from more comments to explain the purpose of each function and the encryption process.
  - Suggestion: Add comments to explain the purpose of each function and the encryption process.

#### General Suggestions

- Consider using a more secure random number generator, such as crypto/rand.Reader, to generate the encryption key and nonce.
- Use a secure method to store the encryption key, such as a Hardware Security Module (HSM) or a secure key store.
- Implement caching for the encryption key and API key to reduce file I/O operations.
- Break down long functions into smaller, more manageable functions.
- Define constants for magic numbers to improve code readability.
- Add comments to explain the purpose of each function and the encryption process.

### main.go

**Overall Score:** 8.5/10

#### Performance (Score: 8.0/10)

- ðŸ”µ INFO [Resource Intensive Operations] The `filepath.Walk` function can be resource-intensive for large directories
  - Suggestion: Consider using a more efficient method for traversing directories, such as using a queue-based approach

- ðŸ”µ INFO [Error Handling] Error handling can be improved to provide more informative error messages
  - Suggestion: Implement more informative error handling to help with debugging and troubleshooting

#### Code Quality (Score: 8.5/10)

- ðŸ”µ INFO [Code Organization] Some functions are quite long and complex, making them difficult to understand and maintain
  - Suggestion: Consider breaking down long functions into smaller, more manageable pieces

- ðŸ”µ INFO [Code Style] Some code blocks have inconsistent indentation and spacing
  - Suggestion: Use a consistent code style throughout the project to improve readability

#### Maintainability (Score: 8.0/10)

- ðŸ”µ INFO [Code Comments] Some functions and variables lack comments, making it difficult to understand their purpose
  - Suggestion: Add comments to explain the purpose and behavior of functions and variables

- ðŸ”µ INFO [Dependency Management] Dependencies are not explicitly managed, which can lead to version conflicts
  - Suggestion: Use a dependency management tool to ensure consistent and reproducible builds

#### Best Practices (Score: 8.5/10)

- ðŸ”µ INFO [Error Handling] Error handling can be improved to provide more informative error messages
  - Suggestion: Implement more informative error handling to help with debugging and troubleshooting

- ðŸ”µ INFO [Code Style] Some code blocks have inconsistent indentation and spacing
  - Suggestion: Use a consistent code style throughout the project to improve readability

#### Security (Score: 9.0/10)

- ðŸ”µ INFO [Authentication] API key is stored in plain text
  - Suggestion: Use a secure method to store API keys, such as environment variables or a secrets manager

- ðŸ”µ INFO [Input Validation] File paths are not validated for potential security vulnerabilities
  - Suggestion: Implement input validation for file paths to prevent potential security vulnerabilities

#### General Suggestions

- Consider using a linter to enforce code style and catch common errors
- Use a testing framework to write unit tests and integration tests
- Implement a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automate testing and deployment
- Use a code review tool to facilitate code reviews and improve code quality
