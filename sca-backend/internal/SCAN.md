  - Suggestion: Consider providing more detailed error messages to improve debugging.

#### Security (Score: 8.0/10)

- ðŸ”µ INFO [Authentication] The code assumes that the 'X-User-ID' header is set by Firebase Auth middleware, but it does not validate the authenticity of the header. This could lead to unauthorized access if the header is tampered with.
  - Line: 15
  - Suggestion: Validate the 'X-User-ID' header using a secure method, such as verifying the Firebase Auth token.

- ðŸ”µ INFO [Error Handling] The code logs errors but continues execution, which could lead to unexpected behavior. For example, if an error occurs while deleting an existing API key, the code will still attempt to generate a new key.
  - Line: 24
  - Suggestion: Consider aborting the execution or returning an error if a critical operation fails.

#### General Suggestions

- Consider implementing rate limiting to prevent abuse of the API key generation endpoint.
- Consider adding logging for successful API key generation and retrieval operations.
- Consider implementing a mechanism to rotate or expire API keys to improve security.
